spam,' FW:\n\n\n thank you for your interest!                           judgment courses offers an extensive audio trainingcourse in  \"how to collect money judgments\"  .          s if you are like many people, you are not even sure what amoney judgment is and  why processing money judgmentscan earn you very substantial income  .if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then youwill have a money judgment against them.you are happy you won but you will soon find out theshocking fact: \"its now up to you to collect on thejudgment\". the court does not require the loser to pay you.the court will not even help you. you must trace the loserdown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.very few people know how to find these assets or what to dowhen they are found. the result is that millions ofjudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.\"in \% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees adime.\"the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemicproportions. right now in the united states there isbetween   and  billion dollars of uncollected moneyjudgment debt  . for every judgment that is paid,  morejudgments take its place.we identified this massive market  years ago and haveactively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented thisbusiness. we have perfected it into a well proven and solidprofession in which only a select few will be trained in thetechniques necessary to succeed.with our first hand experience we have built a course whichteaches you how to start your business in this new unknownand exciting field of processing money judgments.by following the steps laid out in our course and withreasonable effort you can become very successful in theprocessing of money judgments.the income potential is substantial in this profession.  wehave associates who have taken our course and are nowworking full time making $,. to over $,. peryear. part time associates are earning between $,.and $,. per year  . some choose to operate out oftheir home and work by themselves. others build a sizableorganization of  to  people in attractive businessoffices.today our company and our associates have over million dollars in money judgments that we are currentlyprocessing. of this  million,  million is in the formof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.joint ventures are where we make our money. we only breakeven when our course is purchased. we make a \% margin onthe reports we supply to our associates. our reportingcapability is so extensive that government agencies, policeofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to usfor reports.many of our associates already have real estate liens inforce of between  million to over  million dollars.legally this means that when the properties are sold orrefinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is \%interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.annual interest on  million at \% translates to$,. annually in interest income, not counting thepayment of the principal.our associates earn half of this amount or $,. peryear. this is just for interest, not counting principleand not counting the compounding of the interest which canadd substantial additional income. typically companies aresold for  times earnings. just based on simple interestan associate with  million in real estate liens could selltheir business for approximately . million dollars. \% of all of our associates work out of their home; \%are women and \% are part time  .one of the benefits of working in this field is that you arenot under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take offfor a month on vacation then go. the judgments you areworking on will be there when you return. the judgmentsare still in force, they do not disappear.the way we train you is non-confrontational. you use yourcomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. younever confront the debtor. the debtor doesn\'t know who youare. you are not a collection agency.simply stated the steps to successful money processingare as follows:mail our recommended letter to companies and individualswith money judgments. (we train you how to find out whoto write to)\% to \% of the firms and people you write will call youand ask for your help. they call you, you don\'t call themunless you want to.you send them an agreement (supplied in the course) tosign which splits every dollar you collect \% to you and\% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for$,. or $,,..you then go on-line to our computers to find the debtorand their assets. we offer over  powerful reports toassist you. they range from credit reports from all threecredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employmentlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.the prices of our reports are very low. typically / to/ of what other firms charge. for example we charge$. for an individuals credit report when some othercompanies charge $..once you find the debtor and their assets you filegarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in thecourse)when you receive the assets you keep \% and send \% tothe original judgment holder.once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction ofjudgment to the court.

spam,' Weight Loss Secrets Of Doctors And Famous Stars!!.....\ndear friend,this last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in minnesota. &nbsp;the water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the breeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;we had such a great time renewing old friendships, seeing how everyone\'s children had grown, and catching up on everyone\'s lives. &nbsp;the last day we had a family picture taken, thinking that we\'d all send them out as our christmas cards.in october we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but i could not find myself in the picture. &nbsp;i looked and looked and finally got out a magnifying glass. &nbsp;to my horror, i found this dark curly headed woman with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;dear god it was me!!! &nbsp;my body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should a heavy wind arise... it was hideous! &nbsp;i had mirrors in my house but most of them were designed to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and i honestly hadn\'t noticed that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a shapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;i was always so happy that i didn\'t have a lot of wrinkles, &nbsp;but i didn\'t realize that i wasn\'t wrinkled because my skin was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.well, this situation was not  acceptable. &nbsp;but i was at a loss as to what to do. &nbsp;my willpower, well, basically sucks and i had so-o-o much weight to lose that i wasn\'t sure i\'d live long enough to get it all off. &nbsp;plus, i hate diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before i fall off the food wagon. &nbsp;my goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.and then it happened. &nbsp;i received a brochure about a product called berry trim plus. &nbsp;it seemed to contain everything i needed. &nbsp;it curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate possible, no special diets are required, you don\'t have to exercise like a lunatic, it doesn\'t make you feel speeded, &nbsp;and it \'s all natural with no adverse side effects. &nbsp;it also was priced well below other products so i figured that if it didn\'t work i wouldn\'t be out much money. &nbsp;it is guaranteed, but i\'m always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.it\'s been about  weeks now but i swear i\'m beginning to look like that famous cindy person that models. &nbsp;my cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. i swear i look like a new person and a good one at that. &nbsp;berry trim plus  also keeps your skin tight so you don\'t look like a shar pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.i promise you that this product works. &nbsp;it does everything it promises and then some. &nbsp;just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much better and younger. &nbsp;it puts zest back into your life and assures you that you\'ll achieve your weight loss goals. &nbsp;in another few weeks i will reach my goal...something i had given up on. &nbsp;also, hlna  offers an affiliate program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.please keep the faith and order this product now  by clicking below. clickheresincerely,lauriethis message is brought to you by berrytrim affiliate#bccebwe apologize for any email you may haveinadvertently received.please click here to be removed fromfuture mailings.'
