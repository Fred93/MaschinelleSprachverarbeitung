spam,' FW:\n\n\n\n thank you for your interest!\n\n  \n                         \n\njudgment courses offers an extensive audio training\ncourse in \n \"how to collect money judgments\"\n  .         \n\n s\n\n \n\nif you are like many people, you are not even sure what a\nmoney judgment is and \n why processing money judgments\ncan earn you very substantial income\n  .\n\nif you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you\nwill have a money judgment against them.\n\nyou are happy you won but you will soon find out the\nshocking fact: \"its now up to you to collect on the\njudgment\". the court does not require the loser to pay you.\nthe court will not even help you. you must trace the loser\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.\n\nvery few people know how to find these assets or what to do\nwhen they are found. the result is that millions of\njudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.\n\n\"in \% of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a\ndime.\"\n\nthe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic\nproportions. right now in the united states there is\nbetween \n  and  billion dollars of uncollected money\njudgment debt\n  . for every judgment that is paid,  more\njudgments take its place.\n\nwe identified this massive market  years ago and have\nactively pursued judicial judgments since. we invented this\nbusiness. we have perfected it into a well proven and solid\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the\ntechniques necessary to succeed.\n\nwith our first hand experience we have built a course which\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown\nand exciting field of processing money judgments.\n\nby following the steps laid out in our course and with\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the\nprocessing of money judgments.\n\nthe income potential is substantial in this profession. \n we\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now\nworking full time making $,. to over $,. per\nyear. part time associates are earning between $,.\nand $,. per year \n . some choose to operate out of\ntheir home and work by themselves. others build a sizable\norganization of  to  people in attractive business\noffices.\n\ntoday our company and our associates have over \nmillion dollars in money judgments that we are currently\nprocessing. of this  million,  million is in the form\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.\njoint ventures are where we make our money. we only break\neven when our course is purchased. we make a \% margin on\nthe reports we supply to our associates. our reporting\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us\nfor reports.\n\n\nmany of our associates already have real estate liens in\nforce of between  million to over  million dollars.\nlegally this means that when the properties are sold or\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. the norm is \%\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments.\nannual interest on  million at \% translates to\n$,. annually in interest income, not counting the\npayment of the principal.\n\nour associates earn half of this amount or $,. per\nyear. this is just for interest, not counting principle\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can\nadd substantial additional income. typically companies are\nsold for  times earnings. just based on simple interest\nan associate with  million in real estate liens could sell\ntheir business for approximately . million dollars.\n\n\n \% of all of our associates work out of their ho\nme; \%\nare women and \% are part time\n  .\n\none of the benefits of working in this field is that you are\nnot under any kind of time frame. if you decide to take off\nfor a month on vacation then go. the judgments you are\nworking on will be there when you return. the judgments\nare still in force, they do not disappear.\n\nthe way we train you is non-confrontational. you use your\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. you\nnever confront the debtor. the debtor doesn\'t know who you\nare. you are not a collection agency.\n\nsimply stated the steps to successful money processing\nare as follows:\n\nmail our recommended letter to companies and individuals\nwith money judgments. (we train you how to find out who\nto write to)\n\n\% to \% of the firms and people you write will call you\nand ask for your help. they call you, you don\'t call them\nunless you want to.\n\nyou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to\nsign which splits every dollar you collect \% to you and\n\% to them. this applies no matter if the judgment is for\n$,. or $,,..\n\nyou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor\nand their assets. we offer over  powerful reports to\nassist you. they range from credit reports from all three\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.\nthe prices of our reports are very low. typically / to\n/ of what other firms charge. for example we charge\n$. for an individuals credit report when some other\ncompanies charge $..\n\nonce you find the debtor and their assets you file\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.\n(standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the\ncourse)\n\nwhen you receive the assets you keep \% and send \% to\nthe original judgment holder.\n\nonce the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of\njudgment to the court.

(eleven million five\nhundred thousand united states dollars), while \%\nwill be for us (members of this panel) and the\nremaining \% will be used in offsetting all\ndebts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in\nthe cause of this transfer. needless to say, the trust\nreposed on you at this juncture is enormous. in return\nwe demand your complete honesty and trust. it does not matter whether or not your company does\ncontract projects of this nature described here, the\nassumption is that your company won the major contract\nand sub-contracted it out to other companies.  more\noften than not, big trading companies or firms of\nunrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract\nto more specialized firms for execution of such\ncontracts. we are civil servants and we will not\nwant to miss this once in a life time opportunity.you must however, note that this transaction will be\nstrictly based on the following terms and conditions\nas we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed\ncases of business associates running away with funds\nkept in their custody when it finally arrive their\naccounts. we have decided that this transaction will\nbe based completely on the following: (a). our conviction of your transparent honesty and\ndiligence.
