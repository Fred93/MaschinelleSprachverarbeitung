Here is a \nlist of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: \n\n- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in \nindex.html[2]. \n- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. \n- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF\n[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. \n- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the \nbrightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to \nyesterday\'s news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today\'s news. Get it? \nToday\'s newzzz... Never mind. \n- Comments on Ben Hammersley\'s Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a \nFOAF file from an RSS feed. \n- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web\'s future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We\'re losing backward \ncompatibility, isn\'t that great? Well, he seems to think so. \n- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such \nas RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. \n- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to \naccomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing \nlist[11]. Also the comments on Shelley\'s article[12]. \n- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is \nthat unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both \nusers.&#8221; \n- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release \nfor a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. \n- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to \nmaking a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to \ngive it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... \nand plunks it into the oil.&#8221; \n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002324.php\n[2]  http://philringnalda.com/archives/002329.php\n[3]  http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000290.phtml\n[4]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_15_dy.htm\n[5]  http://howto.looselycoupled.com/blog/2002_09_22_dy.htm#85480973\n[6]  http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000707.html\n[7]  http://rss.benhammersley.com/archives/001387.html\n[8]  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-xhtml/?n-wa-9192\n[9]  http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/cc/\n[10] http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/000541.php\n[11] http://groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-dev/\n[12] http://burningbird.net/cgi-bin/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=541\n[13] http://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1032794857&count=1\n[14] http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/0209/23.usable.php\n[15] http://www.usablenet.com/\n[16] http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20020923/UFATTN/Headlines/headdex/headdexInternational_temp/13/13/22/\n\n\n',ham

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over \nthe weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing \nother things that probably don\'t bear repeating in a public forum. I have the \n10:15 doctor\'s appointment that I should have made last round, had I not \nconvinced myself that &#8220;it\'s not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it \nall without prescription drugs. I\'m not making the same mistake this time. I\'ll \nbe back this afternoon. \n\nMy email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me \nat my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. \n\nKevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS \nfeed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of \nbeing able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these \nvariations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that \nmean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different \nvocabularies to express the same statements. That\'s great for producers, not so \ngreat for consumers who have to make sense of it all. \n\nFor each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) \nneeds to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ \ndocumentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented \ndocumentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers \nquestions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in \nmy RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file \nusing this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS \nfeed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. \nAnything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a \ndictionary.\n\n\n\n[1] http://www.peerfear.org/\n\n\n',ham

Jason \nLevine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who \nimplemented it, and she claims it wasn\'t a protest as such, more of an inside \njoke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in \ngeneral) is to make everyone\'s words look the same. Counterpoint: the default \nin most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody\'s \nforcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to \ninsert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. \n\n_Timothy Appnel_: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is &#8220;the format \nformerly known as RSS&#8221;. Sam has already implemented it[5]. \n\n_Nicholas Avenell_: ESF[6]. &#8220;Are you also fed up with the continuing war \nbetween RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. \nSo today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn\'t XML. It \nisn\'t RDF. It\'s just data.&#8221; Sam[7] would love it, then.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, \nwas one. Google News[1] is another. \n\nIn its first day, I\'ve already noticed: \n\n- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth\'s \nterminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by \nthe South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the \nlate evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. \n- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? \nThe most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google\'s coverage is what is a news \nsite, and what isn\'t. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very \nobscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? \n- Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them \ncopies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have \nto find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly. \n\n[1] http://news.google.com/\n[2] http://www.concentric.net/~marsface/glossary.htm#sectT\n    The\nsunrise-sunset line dividing the day and night halves of the Moon or a\nplanet.\n[3] http://www.slashdot.org/\n[4] http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/\n[5] http://www.bluesnews.com/\n[6] http://www.scripting.com/\n[7] http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=\%22Danny+O\%27Brien\%22&btnG=Google+Search\n[8] http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&q=www.ntk.net&btnG=Google+Search\n\n\n',ham

I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current \n    circumstances. \n\n    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two \n    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my \n    husband\'s political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our \n    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider \n    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic \n    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank \n    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds \n    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my \n    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the \n    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and \n    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.  \n\nLink[2] Discuss[3] (_Thanks, Stefan!_)\n\n[1] http://atrios.blogspot.com/2002_08_18_atrios_archive.html#80547516\n[2] http://brainslug.org/archives/000224.html#000224\n[3] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/7zkxnLj3i6Da\n\n\n',ham

It has the ring of something \napocraphyl to me, but it\'s a good read, nevertheless. \n\n    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, \n    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? \n    Because that\'s the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads \n    were built by English expatriates. \n\n    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were \n    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that\'s \n    the gauge they used. \n\n    Why did \"they\" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways \n    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used \n    that wheel spacing. \n\n    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried \n    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, \n    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel \n    ruts... \n\nSnopes says it\'s false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it\'s actually \nlargely true, albeit subject to interpretation.

It could be the most important one that \nhas ever landed in your Inbox.\n\nMULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE\n\nMLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit \nof the \"MLM Dream\" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, \ntheir fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally \nflawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.\n\nThe companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to \ntell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to \ncut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.\n\nHERE\'S GOOD NEWS\n\nThere IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven\'t yet \nabandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income \nyou\'ve dreamed about is easier than you think!\n\nWith your permission, I\'d like to send you a brief letter that will tell you \nWHY MLM doesn\'t work for most people and will then introduce you to \nsomething so new and refreshing that you\'ll wonder why you haven\'t heard of \nthis before.\n\nI promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one \nwill call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the \ninformation. Period.\n\nTo receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type \n\"Send Info\" in the Subject box and hit Send. I\'ll get the information to you \nwithin 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.\n\nCordially,\n\nSiddhi\n\nP.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most \neye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I \nhonestly believe that you will feel the same way once you\'ve read it. And \nit\'s FREE!\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThis email is NEVER sent unsolicited.

The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>\nThe court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>\ndown, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>\nreal estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\n<BR>\nVery few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>\nwhen they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>\nJudgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>\n<BR>\n\"In 79\% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>\ndime.\"<BR>\n<BR>\nThe non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>\nproportions.

For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>\nJudgments take its place.<BR>\n<BR>\nWe identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>\nactively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>\nbusiness. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>\nprofession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>\ntechniques necessary to succeed.<BR>\n<BR>\nWith our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>\nteaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>\nand exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nBy following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>\nreasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>\nprocessing of Money Judgments.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#0000A0\"> We<BR>\nhave associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>\nworking full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>\nand $100,000.00 per year </FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#000000\"> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>\ntheir home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>\norganization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>\noffices.<BR>\n<BR>\nToday our company and our associates have over 126<BR>\nmillion dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>\nprocessing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>\nof joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>\nJoint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>\neven when our course is purchased. We make a 12\% margin on<BR>\nthe reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>\ncapability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>\nofficers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>\nfor reports.<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\nMany of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>\nforce of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>\nLegally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>\nrefinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10\%<BR>\ninterest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>\nAnnual interest on 5 million at 10\% translates to<BR>\n$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>\npayment of the principal.<BR>\n<BR>\nOur associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>\nyear. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>\nand not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>\nadd substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>\nsold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>\nan associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>\ntheir business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>\n<BR>\n</FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#0000A0\"> 92\% of all of our associates work out of their ho=\nme; 43\%<BR>\nare women and 36\% are part time</FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#000000\">  .<BR>\n<BR>\nOne of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>\nnot under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>\nfor a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>\nworking on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>\nare still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>\n<BR>\nThe way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>\ncomputer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>\nnever confront the debtor. The debtor doesn\'t know who you<BR>\nare. You are not a collection agency.<BR>\n<BR>\nSimply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>\nare as follows:<BR>\n<BR>\nMail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>\nwith Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>\nto write to)<BR>\n<BR>\n8\% to 11\% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>\nand ask for your help. They call you, you don\'t call them<BR>\nunless you want to.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>\nsign which splits every dollar you collect 50\% to you and<BR>\n50\% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>\n$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nYou then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>\nand their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>\nassist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>\ncredit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>\nlocates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>\nThe prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>\n1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>\n$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>\ncompanies charge $25.00.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>\ngarnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>\n(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>\ncourse)<BR>\n<BR>\nWhen you receive the assets you keep 50\% and send 50\% to<BR>\nthe original Judgment holder.<BR>\n<BR>\nOnce the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>\nJudgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>\n<BR>\nQuote\'s from several of our students:<BR>\n<BR>\nThomas in area code 516 writes us: \"I just wanted to drop<BR>\nyou a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#0000A0\"> My<BR>\nfirst week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>\n<FONT color=3D\"#000000\">  .

a fabulous resort in \nMinnesota. &nbsp;The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the \nbreeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;We had such a great time renewing old \nfriendships, seeing how everyone\'s children had grown, and catching up on \neveryone\'s lives. &nbsp;The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking \nthat we\'d all send them out as our Christmas cards.<BR>\n<BR>\nIn October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. \nEverybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not \nfind myself in the picture. &nbsp;I looked and looked and finally got out a \nmagnifying glass. &nbsp;To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman \nwith a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;Dear God it was me!!! \n&nbsp;My

mirrors in my house but most of them were \ndesigned to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and I honestly hadn\'t noticed \nthat my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a \nshapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;I was always so happy that I didn\'t have a lot \nof wrinkles, &nbsp;but I didn\'t realize that I wasn\'t wrinkled because my skin \nwas as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.<BR>\n<BR>\nWell, this situation was </FONT><FONT  COLOR=\"#ff0000\" BACK=\"#ffffff\" \nstyle=\"BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff\" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY=\"SANSSERIF\" \nFACE=\"Arial\"
