Well, he seems to think so. - modcc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. - Shelley Powers: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley\'s article[12]. - Ian Hickson: Pingback 1.0[13]. “The best thing about this idea is that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both users.” - New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14].

My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing other things that probably don\'t bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 10:15 doctor\'s appointment that I should have made last round, had I not convinced myself that “it\'s not that bad” and trudged through it all without prescription drugs. I\'m not making the same mistake this time. I\'ll be back this afternoon. My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different vocabularies to express the same statements. That\'s great for producers, not so great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) needs to come along and document best practices. We need better goal-oriented documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers questions written in English. “How do I include personal information in my RSS feed?” is a goal-oriented question. “Create a FOAF file using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS feed” (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a dictionary. [1] http://www.peerfear.org/'

Jason Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who implemented it, and she claims it wasn\'t a protest as such, more of an inside joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in general) is to make everyone\'s words look the same. Counterpoint: the default in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody\'s forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it. Timothy Appnel: More FFKAR, RDF, and FOAF[4]. FFKAR is “the format formerly known as RSS”. Sam has already implemented it[5]. Nicholas Avenell: ESF[6]. “Are you also fed up with the continuing war between RSS 0.9* and 1.0 and 2.0 and whatever else they invent today? Me too. So today I invented the Epistula Syndication Format. ESF. It isn\'t XML. It isn\'t RDF. It\'s just data.” Sam[7] would love it, then. But Movable Type doesn\'t support outputting dates in Unix timestamp format[8], which could be an impediment to mainstream acceptance. Shelley Powers: Consumer Rights and RSS[9]. “I\'m not buying into RSS 0.9x. I\'m not buying into RSS 2.0. I\'m not buying into RSS 1.0. I changed my RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 templates to read the following:” *RSS not supported here* This weblog does not support RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, or RSS 1.0.

Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, was one. Google News[1] is another. In its first day, I\'ve already noticed: - The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth\'s terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. - The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google\'s coverage is what is a news site, and what isn\'t. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? - Big companies spend mucho money paying \"clipping services\" that send them copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

It has the ring of something apocraphyl to me, but it\'s a good read, nevertheless. The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that\'s the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that\'s the gauge they used. Why did \"they\" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel ruts...

There\'s a far better example: The New York Times. Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available for free using an insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called \"the Web\" by typing in the keyword \"www.nytimes.com\". Those people at the New York Times must not understand the Internet or something! More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian and others. Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can\'t get paid. I\'d like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the planet.'

This will go someplace interesting. I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other words, the place where they\'re expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful. At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be when we\'re all advocating the same format. Visualize peace. That\'s basically what I did when I did the 2.0 spec. I know it\'s hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did it, you can too.

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart was racing like it hadn\'t since I was in college. They also did an extensive ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they\'re in the neck and supply my head with blood. More good news there. They\'re clear, free of plaque, healthy, not diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general artery disease. That\'s good because there would be a risk of stroke if they were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn\'t working very well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I asked the doctor, does this mean I\'m going to die sooner, and he said no. Does it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we\'ll do an angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass because of this is small. That\'s quite a relief. I don\'t like the idea of part of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

Let me emphasize something here: if you think Mozilla\'s current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not the target audience for Phoenix. Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you. - The link toolbar is: - critical to my day-to-day use - vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn\'t everybody use Bugzilla? - link what? - The sidebar is - indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution - not cool enough, since i can\'t float and dock all my panels and have splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... - a waste of real estate - Form auto-fill - is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information first - should just happen automatically - Downloads - should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! - should be clearly visible and understandable. - Toolbars should - be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be able to edit existing buttons\' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and mow my lawn and... - be customizable within reason - Composer should - always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. Everywhere! - not be part of a Web browser. - Mail should - be part of my browser program. Aren\'t they the same app? There is a difference? - be a separate application. Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to the \"optional add-on\" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. Why? A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The geek features aren\'t inflicted on you by default. Finally, remember that Phoenix\'s UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions within Netscape.

It\'s a pretty basic browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla\'s no tolerance policy for regressions. While this \"line in the sand\" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied! You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious rule. It\'s like you start with an empty elevator that says \"Capacity: 10 people.\" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes he\'d get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn\'t. Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way to the third floor, so he\'s useless, and everyone wishes he\'d get off too. He doesn\'t though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies. We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the features that didn\'t work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren\'t there in Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.'

I have to admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, \"Do you really agree with mpt\'s Top 10 list? He\'s quoted you at the top of the list!\" Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is an issue that needs to be addressed. That\'s something. To cover the list specifically: - Navigator chrome structure - While I don\'t necessarily agree with mpt\'s proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem. - Speed - can\'t argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain speed. - Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you\'ll see that the textfield widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It\'s buggy, slow, misbehaves, and doesn\'t edit the way you\'d expect. This is IMO Chimera\'s top usability problem. - Message display - Yes. No argument here. - Search - Yeah, it\'s a mess. Don\'t know if it would be in my top ten, but it\'s a mess. - Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., you can eliminate the New submenu easily). - Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla. - Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. If you don\'t like it, complain about Win32, but don\'t cite this as a Mozilla usability problem when we\'re following the conventions of the operating system. (We simply listen for the WMCONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 wants to fire it.) - Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is completely irrelevant. - Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously overconfigurable. [1] http://www.blakeross.com/archives/20020818index.html#80418641 [2] http://mpt.phrasewise.com'

Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. End result: people don\'t enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not capturing all that information. You can always \"page fault\" to get the information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be dll-version-related, only then bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the DLL info? Similarly, it\'s always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on Windows 98SE? Aha! You can\'t. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so this search doesn\'t make sense in the first place. The info wasn\'t captured. Do a full text search for 98SE and you\'ll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on the computer in question and while you\'re at it, a photograph of the tester\'s workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to keep track of bugs, which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system, because they didn\'t know what all those fields were. The real bug-\"tracking\" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, \"does FogBUGZ support custom fields?\" Rather than giving our usual answer (\"no. on purpose.\") over the last few weeks I\'ve been saying, \"can you please tell me what fields you would need? We\'re trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it.\" The interesting thing is, almost all of the fields people ask for are already in FogBUGZ, and the other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn\'t be fields. And in fact, our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, but I didn\'t, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses. But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product. \"Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields.\" Righto. It\'s true. And who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But it\'s still rude of me to tell customers that we don\'t have that feature for their own good, even though it usually is, and we\'re losing some sales because of it. Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don\'t use it. At least we won\'t lose any sales :) [1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ'

I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn\'t believe me (or didn\'t care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1]. I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn\'t listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0: Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn\'t let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space. Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don\'t understand how to make a good browser, or they don\'t care. Their engineers tell them what they\'re doing wrong, and they don\'t listen. Maybe you\'ll listen to the public. How about eWeek\'s article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla\'s Shadow[3]?

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There\'s a lot of evidence that advertising just doesn\'t work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where consumers\' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first rose to prominence, advertisements did work. We hadn\'t built up our immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much. Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should air during that time. I don\'t believe that it\'s the networks\' responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and some aren\'t. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch TV together during this hour. It should be the parent\'s responsibility to police a child\'s television viewing. If you don\'t want your kids watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer, then don\'t let them, but don\'t campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don\'t like its content. If you don\'t think a show is appropriate, don\'t let your kids watch it. The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example of one such show is Malcolm in the Middle. I would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn\'t really mind, but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous. [1] http://www.parentstv.org/'

This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn\'t successful, the Mac is  over. It\'s not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site that only works on Netscape. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5\%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4\%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: \"Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it\'s a Mac application a net plus? (No.)\" Well duh. Your product would have to appeal to 25 times more Mac users [as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money. Now, you may want to make an emotional appeal to developing for the Mac. That\'s fine. If you like Macs and you\'re doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we\'re talking investment, you have to tell me why you\'re going to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there\'s less competition in your category on the Mac; maybe you\'re in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate (they don\'t, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can\'t sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you\'re going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier.

She happens to be my daughter. Oh. Then I guess you have. - I\'m not a smart man, but I know what love is. - Of course, you won\'t be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can\'t you? - The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn\'t change the fact that it was going to happen. - Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place. - You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

This excerpt was rather amusing. It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape\'s best new feature, tabbed browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, Yecies, of Netscape, said, \"That\'s true, but the engineer who\'s working on it [for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape.\"  Yes, ok, I suppose that\'s true if by \"Netscape employee\" you really meant \"Apple employee.\" and by \"always done with the intention of fostering general browsing usability for Netscape\" you meant \"was done in a weekend for Mozilla because I thought MultiZilla was cool.\" Here\'s how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed browser that embedded WinIE. MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor\'s more obscure capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that the tab behavior wasn\'t encapsulated cleanly into a widget. I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files would be minimal. Once I established that it didn\'t degrade performance in the single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment. The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still didn\'t get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn\'t know what to make of it. Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I\'m sure Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can\'t you just see it now? We\'ll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say \"you should do this\" or \"you should do that\", they get completely ignored (or blown off), but when CNet says \"We didn\'t like this, or we didn\'t like that.\", Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic. [1] http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/10/browserwars/ [2] http://www.salon.com [3] http://www.mozdev.org [4] http://www.netcaptor.com'

It\'s like a freaking haiku of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental revolution. Researchers at Boston\'s Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her own cells. \"The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize dentistry,\" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that focuses on oral and facial science.

Turkey City is a venerable science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding what works and what doesn\'t in a work of science fiction: Squid on the Mantelpiece Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It\'s hard to properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad\'s bank overdraft when a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the conventional dramatic proprieties and SF\'s extreme, grotesque, or visionary thematics is known as the \"squid on the mantelpiece.\" Card Tricks in the Dark Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose. (Attr.

Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he blogged the hell out of the talk: Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), \"the Betamax affair\"... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. This principle is under attack. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, override copy protection.

This week, Dan takes Valenti\'s arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood\'s agenda really entails: So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that communicate so they can\'t make copies the copyright holders don\'t explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used to violate copyrights. Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it\'s nothing but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some things that aren\'t infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. Saying it doesn\'t make it so.

The first day\'s findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the initiative for artists\' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for \"Hell Freezes Over,\" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no more than a 10\% \"reserve\" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

As soon as I\'m in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I really think I\'m going to pick this up. That\'s partly because it costs less than half as much as its current competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively high- speed \"GPRS\" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice time is another story -- more on that later.) Another reason I like the Sidekick\'s prospects: It was designed for, and will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing hybrids focus on \"enterprise\" customers -- the big businesses that are supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most clearly don\'t at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their own words, \"Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic.\" I am that demographic!

Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. \"This is Frank Bellknap Long!\" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a lecture on Long\'s oeuvre. There can\'t be more than a handful of people on this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his head and belts out the song in a growling voice that\'s monster-movie low. \"No reason! No corners!\" he shouts. Two minutes later, they\'re done with the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. \"Our next song is about Harlan Ellison!\" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. Blöödhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing themselves as \"edu-core,\" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: \"The Faster You Go Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.\" Link[1] Discuss[2] (Thanks, Zed[3]!)

As several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used to be the #1 \"mark\"[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for \"go to hell\" [4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for \"talentless hack\"[6] no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive with complaints and speculation: - New update, pagerank death?[8] - September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] - Let\'s find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely false. Searching diveintomark.org for \"gimli\"[11] finds my entry of July 29[12] , where \"Gimli\" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google\'s search results in general appear to be significantly degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they\'re tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It didn\'t take long. - Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and Google absolutely knows I\'m in the US based on my IP address). - Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. - Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself (I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I didn\'t care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn\'t that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com [21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their results for \"eminem\"[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the beginning of the end of Google\'s reign?

Filmmakers such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall\'s film performances such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to try to calculate the mathematical systems employed! Link[1] Discuss[2] (Thanks, Jef[3]!)

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other \"promiscuous\" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a \"rejected\" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around and tell people running Etherpeg to turn off the firewall (and vice-versa).

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, Windows Installer) could do even 25\% of what our setup program needed to do, so I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made. So even if you\'re looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I\'ll write more about what I learned. One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don\'t have to have someone else\'s stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Something like 100K books published in the US. Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is wrong: most aren\'t pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over for years on shelves for three months, doesn\'t sell, that\'s it, and the author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. Oblivion is fate of most books: \"Piracy would be the best thing for those books.\" People wouldn\'t pirate them in general, because people generally like to respect the rights of creators. \"Piracy is a marginal act; it takes away some of the cream.\" Publishing won\'t go away, but it will change the idea of who is a publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and position in bookstores. Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we\'re stuck for a long time with \"some mistakes.\" Link[1] Discuss[2] (via Dan Gillmor\'s eJournal[3]) [1] http://blog.glennf.com/gmblog/archives/00000254.htm [2] http://www.quicktopic.com/boing/H/K3FKZ6jSJe2Px [3] http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dangillmor/ejournal/'

?,' History of the tilde','From rssfeeds@jmason.org Fri Oct 4 11:01:50 2002  yyyy@localhost.example.com  from jalapeno [127.0.0.1] by localhost with IMAP (fetchmail-5.9.0) for jm@localhost (single-drop); Fri, 04 Oct 2002 11:01:20 +0100 (IST)  yyyy@example.com From: diveintomark  Fri, 04 Oct 2002 08:00:03 -0000 Content-Type: text/plain; encoding=utf-8 URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#historyofthetilde Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00 So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind that. I don\'t want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the tilde. Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for “home directory”, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username will take you to someone else\'s, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their publichtml subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you\'re actually being served files from that user\'s Sites directory within their home directory. But I don\'t want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google ( old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene Wallingford, which, like Jukka\'s home page, can not be referenced without a tilde. In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a tilde in its URL. Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. Digging further, we find this post of Jukka\'s from 1998[5], in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the ñ (now referenced in HTML as the named entity ñ), but somewhere along the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses. Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for #[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee meeting, when it was proposed “as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease SHARE”. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn\'t until 1991, when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of yesterday called “Deja News”, and kids today call “Google Groups”), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, that William Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially pronounced “squiggle”. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary [10] to this very day. I\'m not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ASCII characters. As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem [11]. In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. In February 1988, an editor\'s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements (history,tilde,job control)[16]. As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed in the APL-11 character set[18]. In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying bugs in csh). In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced “tilde”[20], prompting this typographical pun[21]. And that\'s the earliest reference I can find. So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for “home directory”? When did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites? I don\'t know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it\'s about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. But I digress.) If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the pro-CSS camp[1]. So anyway, d\'ya remember that argument that went something like “you should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile devices”? Well, it\'s crap[2]. There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim to know a lot about[7]), among others. But “because it\'ll future-proof your site for the next generation of mobile devices” is not one of them. The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. Oops.

In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... So, why don\'t cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as disability and social security taxes.

Rob \"Pringles Can\" Flickenger wrote it up. It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other \"promiscuous\" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a \"rejected\" message. So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around and tell people running Etherpeg to turn off the firewall (and vice-versa).

Their front-line customer service sucks, but the prices and network can\'t be beat. T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta Jones. The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents per minute.)

As many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. I\'m incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn\'t (and still can\'t) think of anything I\'d rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I\'m sort of embarassed to have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by camping in line with us. So, I\'ll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you\'d like to come with us, let me know. I was hoping I\'d be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who couldn\'t make it, but as I read in today\'s Times, only lawyers and those with official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an interesting account. In a related irony, today was \"Disney Day\" at Borders[5], where they played Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through The Practice of Programming. In an unrelated note, if you haven\'t been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, I highly recommend it.

Also, because of the ability to send high-speed data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable – such as collecting seismic data at the drill bit – may now be possible. With high-resolution seismic data collected \"ahead of the bit,\" operators could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet spots and away from less productive areas.

We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince him. After it was clear that wouldn\'t work, we threatened to bomb them and begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned to invade two months before the attacks. While it\'s not clear they knew about 9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable because it\'s too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn\'t carry them out. It\'s far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. \"Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us.

For example, action games played in closed-in locations need an engine allowing fast rendering of a few hundred polygons, a high frame rate, and a high level of details to impress players. Conversely, a game that is taking place outdoors requires quite a different approach. This features present one one technique for hidden surface removal usable in 3D engines using tilizing object occlusion.'

Recently, in private email, Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many ways encouraged. *Tools:* 1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work) 1 Monsters, Inc. Collector\'s Edition DVD (any DVD should work) 1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 \"Jaguar\" *Process:* 1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for you. 2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEOTS folder to your hard drive. Ejct the DVD. 3. In DVD Player, select \"Open VIDEOTS Folder...\" from the File menu. Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEOTS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven\'t done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I\'ve used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, please let me know. However, if it is true, then it\'s very interesting that Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.'

I say half-hearted because I\'m still application-centric, and I don\'t go as far with keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\'t use the desktop at all (never have, on any system), and I don\'t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS home\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \"$ Explorer work\", \"\% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\'s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\'m done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn\'t have a lot of memory). I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And bash, which I don\'t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\'t let the system position the window. In Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that\'s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (d:\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\'s bash shell for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. I don\'t use Windows\' useless directory structure for user home directories. On my D drive I have d:\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under CVS control—also set as my home directory using the HOME environment variable), d:\\work (contains directories for each work project, also under CVS), d:\\incoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and d:\\backup (used by Emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created CVS projects). I don\'t know or care what\'s where on my C drive. I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\home\\phone. It is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is my single most backed-up possession. Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI [16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

Unlike everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying \"This can\'t go on board.\" \"I don\'t remember packing that,\" I said. I let her confiscate it. I called my Mom. She doesn\'t remember packing it either. Is there some sort of terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people\'s suitcases? I can\'t see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I\'m on? Once I\'m on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the scissors? Perhaps it\'s some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of A New Kind of Science, they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever terrorists. *Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert. === Waiting for Wireless === Now I am at O\'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral\'s Club while businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, I had an Admiral\'s Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, you know)--I doubt they will accept it. === Irony === According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his flight. I think of what I\'d say if I ran into him. \"Jack!\" I\'d exclaim, as if we were old pals. \"Going to the Eldred case?\" Of course he was. \"Going to be a good one.\" \"Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?\" I\'d ask. \"You said you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the Internet. What ever happened to that?\" I imagine him mumbling and looking down at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing these airline announcements keep me up to date. === Automatic Flush Toilets === Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three times. This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer\'s web site. === Arrival === I\'ve arrived in D.C.--once again, I\'m sitting a block away from my hotel on the sidewalk borrowing someone\'s connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now for the meetings and parties. Sorry for not responding to your email. I\'m rather busy. ;-)'

This entire article could be rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let\'s do that. If it were April Fool\'s Day, the Net\'s only official holiday, and you wanted to design a “novelty format” to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: - It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world. - It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. - It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn\'t a GUID, and using an obsolete date format that couldn\'t easily be sorted by date. - Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. - After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on. - After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers. RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it\'s pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format, we have the worst one possible. Except, of course, for all the others. The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities—RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place. - Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. - Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed HTML elements. - Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn\'t matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility. Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type Description? Why is the aggregators\' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to “do RSS right”—most notably RSS 1.0 in the year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: - Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. - Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 feed—in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world—by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. - Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be flourishing. Evolvable formats—those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways—have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. - Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world\'s metadata in RDF. Without such perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. There is no middle ground. - What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces. - Finally, Orgel\'s Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie Orgel—“Evolution is cleverer than you are”. As with the list of RSS\'s obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it “did things right”. However, the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul. Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect syndication format, just the best one that\'s also currently practical. Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.

Instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.\"* There are a couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there\'s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant. Second, it\'s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: [IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup Screenshot)] The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha didn\'t know that!). It\'s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you\'ve left their system in an indeterminate state. In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where I can display a useful error message. And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we never, ever require a reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft\'s web server). So part one of the batch is \"Stop IIS.\" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it would be extremely rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it\'s not like I don\'t need to write the code for \"Start IIS\" for the end of the batch. So the code to rollback \"Stop IIS\" is already written. No big deal, I just need to call it at the right place. I think one reason that people think you should \"gather all the info and then do all the work\" is because with very large installation programs that are very slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user\'s time. Indeed even FogBUGZ setup does 95\% of its work at the very end. But the \"create account\" operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn\'t apply here. Even our 95\% of the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for IIS to stop and start. *\"Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.\"* First of all, leave your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed to figure out in high school that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring. Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, since I am writing the code, is what is more productive for Joel Spolsky. And I don\'t know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ really, really well. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do in this setup program are things like \"grant the Logon as Service privilege to an account.\" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you find is about 75\% C code, maybe 20\% VB code, and 5\% everything else. Yes, I know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30\% of the code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library I\'ve been using for years to make wizards. *\"Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers\' money. Good Setup programs don\'t increase sales.\"* This was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: - Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code. - Delight my customers. When I\'m trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won\'t hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade. I\'m still using an old version of SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the new version is much better, because I just can\'t bear the thought of another morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all the little SSH windows, some su\'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it suspend, trying to guess why we can\'t get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it\'s too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don\'t have a SETUP program. - Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it and say \"Aha!\" *\"How can we make WISE[4] better?\" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the reasons his product wasn\'t adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

I clocked my “long loop” today and discovered that the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the “short loop” I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 bug. This is very upsetting. I\'ve lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds them, can you please let me know? Thank you. I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner smiling. We\'d drive by runners, point at them, and say, “Look, another runner... not smiling!” This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a runner. Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves running. There\'s other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, run around the block. Tomorrow you\'ll run around the block, and the next day you\'ll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you\'ll find you can run a mile. Then one day you\'ll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, then get invigorated and run another mile. And then you\'re a runner. That\'s it, really. It\'s not complicated. You run, and you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running thing out aren\'t actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and run. There\'s other stuff too, but it doesn\'t really matter until you\'re already a runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don\'t worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you\'re just another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading Runner\'s World.'
